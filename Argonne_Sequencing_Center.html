<div style="position: relative; bottom: 70px;"><p>The Environmental Sample Preparation and Sequencing 
Facility (ESPSF) at Argonne National Laboratory is a state-of-the-art facility for nucleic acid extrac
tion, library preparation, and ultra-high throughput sequencing. The facility was originally establish
ed in 2007 at Argonne National Laboratory and is housed in Argonne's Computing, Environment and Life S
ciences (CELS) directorate, providing world-class computation power, software, and expertise critical 
to the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of the unprecedented volume of genetic information be
ing generated on next generation DNA sequencing platforms. The facility provides resources and service
s to Argonne and University of Chicago users, and to the broader scientific community (both US and abr
oad). ESPSF is involved in a wide range of scientific research from the sequencing of metagenomic samp
les to both 16S and 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing for microbial community analysis, and ITS sequencing 
for fungal community analysis. The ESPSF team helps users determine the most efficient and cost effect
ive approach to meet their research needs.</p>
<p>The ESPSF currently supports the Illumina HiSeq2500 and Illumina MiSeq for high-throughput sequenci
ng. The Illumina HiSeq2500 offers around 200 million reads at 50bp, 100bp, 150bp, or 250bp in length p
er read. The Illumina MiSeq generates over 24 million reads at 50bp, 150 bp, 250bp or 300bp in length
per read. Applications on both the Illumina HiSeq2500 and MiSeq include shotgun metagenome sequencing,
 metatranscriptome sequencing, rRNA-based amplicon library sequencing, and genome sequencing and reseq
uencing.</p>
